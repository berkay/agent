# Neptuen agent
Neptune agent is a lightweight piece of software written in GO, which runs on your servers to run runbooks and report the results back to Neptune.io service. We use agents to accomplish this because they provide an easy way to run runbooks without exposing any open ports and without requiring SSH access to your servers.
